    <h1>Nova Scotia Style Donair</h1>

<p>If you've ever been to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, hopefully you had the chance to try a donair. This is the recipe used to make those donairs in some places in town. Remember to knead that meat until it's almost a paste!</p>

<p>Donair, inspired by Döner Kebab, is a uniquely Canadian variation on the gyro sandwich. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons all-purpose flour (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons dry mustard</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crushed dried chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <!-- <h3>Step 1</h3> -->
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a large baking pan with sides.</p></li>
        <!-- <h3>Step 2</h3> -->
        <li><p>Place beef, lamb, flour, salt, oregano, dry mustard, 2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chile pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; knead all ingredients together with your hands until mixture is like a paste, about 10 minutes. Roll the meat mixture into a large loaf shape, and place into the prepared pan.</p></li>
        <!-- <h3>Step 3</h3> -->
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from oven; place meat on a drip rack until completely cool to allow juices and fat to drain. Refrigerate meat for 6 hours or overnight.</p></li>
        <!-- <h3>Step 4</h3> -->
        <li><p>Stir evaporated milk, sugar, and 2 teaspoons garlic powder together in a small bowl; gradually stir in vinegar just until mixture thickens.</p></li>
        <!-- <h3>Step 5</h3> -->
        <li><p>Slice donair meat into strips about 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch thick. Fry meat strips in single-sandwich batches in a skillet over medium-high heat until meat begins to crisp at the edges; remove from pan. Quickly rub 1 pita round lightly with water; fry pita in same frying pan, turning once, just until warm, about 1 minute.</p></li>
        <!-- <h3>Step 6</h3> -->
        <li><p>Spread pita with about 1/2 tablespoons of sauce mixture, top with donair meat, and garnish with onion, tomato, and more sauce; repeat with remaining meat and pita.</p></li>
